Exploratory Data Analysis
A first look at the data


• detection of mistakes
• checking of assumptions
• preliminary selection of appropriate models
• determining relationships among the explanatory variables, and
• assessing the direction and rough size of relationships between explanatory
and outcome variables.

Exploratory data analysis is generally cross-classified in two ways. First, each
method is either non-graphical or graphical. And second, each method is either
univariate or multivariate (usually just bivariate)

Non-graphical methods generally involve calculation of summary statistics,
while graphical methods obviously summarize the data in a diagrammatic or pictorial way

It is almost
always a good idea to perform univariate EDA on each of the components of a
multivariate EDA before performing the multivariate EDA.

each of the
categories of EDA have further divisions based on the role (outcome or explanatory) and type (categorical or quantitative) of the variable(s) being examined.

The four types of EDA are univariate non-graphical, multivariate nongraphical, univariate graphical, and multivariate graphical.
